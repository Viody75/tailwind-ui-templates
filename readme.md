# Welcome to my Fun Projects

Initiated by me (Viody Alfaridzi)

## What is it about?

This is me being bored, so we might do something interesting and share it here. However it's a collection of simple Tailwind UIs.

## The Tech?

Obviously Tailwind, HTML and Good ol plain Vanilla JS. Because I'm building an easy to use template Tailwind UIs so we just use Tailwind CDN to simplify the setup thingies.

## How to use?

Well you can just copy it straight from the Repo or simply clone it to your machine.

### Important Notes

You may use the project however you like, but please don't forget to give me a shoutout if you use it in your project.
And please don't sell it as your own for i'm giving it for free.
Also, if you want to contribute, just open an issue or PR, I'll be happy to help.
